This project is devoted to the analysis of scientific articles on the topic of the main types of blood cells. I'm trying to determine what type of cell the article is about using machine learning and information about the cell markers mentioned in the article.

The process consisted of two stages: automatic data collection (file parser.py) into a database (cell_markers.sqlite), and then analysis of the obtained data and training of the model (file data_processing.ipynb). In the same file you can see a more detailed description of the work process.
